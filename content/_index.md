 Hey! I'm Hugo Verhelst, a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture at the University of Pavia (Italy). 

 My current work focusses on the development of structural analysis tools for thin membrane structures at sea, using the mathematical concept of Isogeometric Analysis. In particular, I mainly contribute to the field of computational structural analysis and I am a co-developer of the [Geometry+Simulation Modules (G+Smo)](https://github.com/gismo).
