### Accommodations
For the ones who want to stay for one or more nights in Delft in the period between 17-01-2024 and 20-01-2024 I managed to make some arrangements with hotels: 

* [The Social Hub Delft](https://www.thesocialhub.co/delft/) is a modern hotel next to the train station of Delft. Using the code **TUDELFT2024**, you can get a 15% discount on Deluxe Queen (€84/night), Executive Queen (€89/night) and Deluxe King (€92/night) rooms.

* [Hotel Johannes Vermeer](http://www.hotelvermeer.nl/) is an authentic hotel in the city center of Delft. They offer normal double rooms (€99/night) and deluxe double rooms (€117/night) for maximum two people, a deluxe room with an extra bed (€147/night) for three people and family rooms (€154/night) for four people. You can get a discount by mentioning my name in your booking.

Since Delft is located between Rotterdam and Den Haag, one could also book a room in those cities. There are trains running between the main stations all day and night. 

### Party

After the defense, a reception will be organized. On the 19th of January 2024, I will organize a party in Delft, for which invites will be sent via private messengers. Contact me for more info.
